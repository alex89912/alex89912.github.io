# Another bad day
Covid hit me but nothing can stop me from building some cliffs or mountains in a block game

## Journey
|      |                                |
|------|--------------------------------|
| 9pm  | Wake up                        |
| 10pm | Shower time (who needs that?)  |
| 11pm | Build cliffs                   |
| 12pm | Eat                            |
| 1am  | _sleep time_ (not a good idea) |
| 2am  | Gaming with friends            |
| 3pm  | Write this story               |

Maybe I am not the best writer in my country.
